# Question9
I’ll get disappointed and most likely discouraged.
As much as I will pick myself up eventually, I’m scared of how long it might take. I hardly share most of the things or changes happening to me to my family because I do not want them to one day ask, ‘what happened?’ or ‘we thought’. 
I feel that would add salt to the wound. As for my community, they have no idea that I have bigger plans for them. 
But even if things don’t go my way career-wise, I’m still willing and planning on pledging my time and knowledge to those who need it.
